            BAMS admissions are done only through one source and that is through entrance exams. 
            Candidates can attend entrance exams in order to get seats in the best college. Students can attempt NEET entrance 
            exam which is National eligibility cum entrance test conducted by NTA National Testing Agency. Admissions to BAMS 
            course will be done on the basis of the NEET UG ranks and scores. Here the 12th merit quota does not play a major 
            role because of entrance exam being a compulsion. AYUSH plays a very pivotal role in the counseling process and seat 
            allotments in Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy, siddha and homeopathy. Every year the cut off for government seat changes 
            which is difficult to predict the cut off ranks. After the counseling process there will be a personal interview round 
            by colleges to pick the best candidates. 
            The basic eligibility for NEET exam to get seat for BAMS is 119 for 720.

                  BAMS has gone to be as one of the most chosen careers after MBBS in medicine. BAMS being a very vast field has offered a wide array of career opportunities
                   to many students. Ayurveda being an alternative medicine, many people still choose to go with the alternative method as it has no side effects. BAMS has 
                   large scope both in India and abroad. 
                </p>

                <p class="card-text text-dark">
                 Since was an old traditional medicine many abroad countries intend to have Indian Ayurveda doctors and practitioners so that they learn the knowledge more 
                 and spread the reach of the medicines to other nations. There are bright career chances for BAMS graduates specifically in medical and tourism field abroad. 
                 In countries like US, UK, Greece and Russia. Ayurvedic treatment has spread its reach and gone to invade other countries as well. 
                </p>

               
                <p class="card-text text-dark">
                Many well-known pharmaceutical laboratories have provided research in this field. And the results are massively good as the treatment has worked out well. 
                Candidates can have a great career in medicinal field with the growing demand of ayurvedic medicine in the economic market. After completion of their BAMS 
                course, many students either join clinics and practice or they go for their higher education such as MD course which is for 3 years. 
                </p>

                <p class="card-text text-dark">
               BAMS graduates can work as practitioners for better experience before they want to do something of their own. They get hired in both public sector and private 
               ayurvedic clinics. Mostly BAMS graduates are employed in healthcare sector, medicals, hospitals, life care centre etc.
