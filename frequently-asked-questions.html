          </h4>
          <p>
            Marine Biology and Marine engineering are two different courses with
            marine biology being a 3 year tenure whereas marine engineering for
            4 years. Both might seem to be same as marine deals with water
            bodies but it's not so. Many students get confused while choosing
            both the courses as they think many subjects would be similar in
            both. Marine Biology can be stated as the study of life of living
            organisms in oceans, seas, and other water bodies. Marine biology
            consists of various specializations in ecology, geology, botany,
            genetics, fisheries. Any student more interested into aqua life can
            choose marine biology which now has good scope in many fisheries
            department of both public and private sector.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whereas Marine engineering deals with the production, designing,
            manufacturing, maintenance and operation of all mechanisms of ships
            and heavy metal bodies on water. It deals with both the internal and
            external mechanism of the ship it's functioning and operation and
            all technical aspects. Marine engineering which was then a lost
            course is now a booming on demand course with best career
            opportunities.

          <p>
            Now anybody wanting to know the difference between infrastructure
            and instrumentation engineering can refer to the answer given below.
          </p>

          <p>
            B.Tech Infrastructure Engineering which is a 4- year undergraduate
            course that students who are interested in building and designing
            can take up. Infrastructure as we all knows the different structure
            and buildings around us which make the community or the place look
            more outstanding. Infrastructure engineering deals with the
            technical aspect of civil engineering in building, designing,
            constructing of modern structures such as buildings, highways, dams,
            roads, canals etc. It contributes a lot towards the overall
            development of infrastructure and construction in a specified way.
          </p>

          <p>
            While we look into the terminology infrastructure and
            instrumentation may sound a little similar whereas both the courses
            are polar opposites. B.tech Instrumentation Engineering is again a 4
            year undergraduate course which studies the designing and
            controlling of automated instruments in industries which different
            kinds of machines and instruments are put in use. It's a specialized
            branch of electronics and electrical engineering and majorly focuses
            on the operation of principles used in measuring the instruments and
            various automated systems.

          <p>
            Optometry can be referred to as the study of eye and vision. But
            have we ever wondered what might be the difference between bachelors
            of optometry and BSc O.ptometry?
          </p>

          <p>
            Bachelor of Optometry also known as B.Optom is a 4 year
            undergraduate degree course for students who are having an interest
            towards learning about eye the most important element of the body
            where both theoretical and practical knowledge of eyesight and
            dealing with all types of visual disorders. It is usually a 3 years
            course but with a 1 year rotary internships to work in ENT clinics
            for students to get more technical knowledge. Any student who wants
            a career in the field of optometry can opt this specialized field as
            it provides numerous career opportunities in the optometry field.
            The eligibility for this is the student must have finished their
            12th with PCB as mandatory subjects and have to score 50-55% as
            minimum marks in the above stated subject.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whereas B.Sc Optometry is a 3 year undergraduate course which deals
            in the examination and diagnosis of management and diseases with
            disorders in the vision system of a human. It helps in achieving
            personal growth by enhancing the ability to see and feel things and
            comes up with new technologies for better eyesight. Optometry

          <p>
            Pharmacy has always been an evolutionary course for students and has
            been gaining much traction over the last few years post pandemic.
            Pharmaceutical is a broad field that deals with the application of
            drugs, medicines, research and health care development fields. If
            any student planning to carry forward a career in Pharmacy industry
            should go step wise. So either it can be diploma in pharmacy or
            undergraduate or Bachelor in pharmacy which is a 4 year
            undergraduate course. They have both options of B.Pharm and D. Pharm
            which is nothing but bachelors and diploma. While the diploma course
            is for a period of 2 years, bachelor's is for a period of 4 years.
            Diploma offers students a choice to start off their career right
            after the completion of their 10th standard. And the eligibility
            criteria for bachelor of pharmacy is the student should have
            completed their 12th with a minimum of 55% in Physics, chemistry,
            and biology. The fee structure for d. pharm would be lesser as
            compared to that of B.Pharm. The career prospects for both the
            courses would be the same as compared to B.Pharm which is a degree
            course and more professional in nature is given more preference as
            it offers good career opportunities. Career options for D.Pharm,
            given a diploma holder can work in a Pharmacy, drug manufacturing
            company, education sector, medical retail store, etc. Whereas the
            career options for a B.Pharm graduate can be that of a drug
            inspector, research analyst, and pharm consultant, pharmacy lecturer
            in college and work in government or defence medical system.
          </p>

          <p>
            As we can see that both the courses have their own pros and cons but
            preferably B.Pharm would be better for a good and better career for
            success in long term.

          <p>
            Dairy products and milk products are the basic necessities of every
            household. But how far do we know that how they're processed and
            made into processing units for consumption is one good way to
            understand its functions. For those students those who want to know
            more about the dairy technology can choose courses affiliated to it
            such as B.Sc Dairy technology or B.Tech dairy technology. Now both
            the courses sound the same so this might be a dilemma for students
            as to which course is what. Now B.Sc and B.Tech are two variants of
            science and technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            B.Sc in Dairy technology is a 3 year undergraduate course for
            students who want to learn more about dairy products and its
            production. B.Sc Dairy technology is a science that deals with the
            study of milk processing and its products. it studies the packaging,
            processing, transportation, storage and distribution of dairy
            products by implementing the science of biochemistry, nutrition and
            bacteriology. It is a science which teaches how to produce and
            preserve and properly utilise dairy products. After the completion
            of this course students can take up M.Sc in Dairy Technology or work
            in a dairy plant. They can be dairy consultant in a milk plant or
            ice cream units. They can also work as a teacher or lecturer in
            college or research institutes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whereas B. Tech in Dairy Technology is 4 year undergraduate course
            in engineering which deals with the study of production, processing,
            and quality control check of different dairy related and milk
            related products. B. Tech is a technological based degree which not
            just studies the on-going methods but also focuses on new techniques
            discovered for different milk products such as cheese, and its
            variants by using scientific technology with a crush of engineering
            principles and tools. Students need to attend entrance exams for
            admissions in this course as it is an on demand course and has
            various and immense career opportunities. Students can work as diary
            technologistâ€™s dairy nutritionist, microbiologist, dairy production
            manager and much more. So B.Sc and B.Tech for dairy technology are
            two variants of science and technology where B.Sc is more
            theoretical based and B.Tech is more practical oriented and has many
            career opportunities.

          <p>
            CS and CA are both professional courses in the commerce sector and
            have high career scope in both India and abroad. CA also known as
            chartered accountant governed by the ICAI Indian chartered
            accountants of India is an international credential that a student
            earns by following the CA course and writing exams which are held by
            the ICAI and is a very certified professional career for anyone
            those who are interested to set an ensemble in the accounting world.
            A chartered accountant looks after the books of accounts of an
            organisation, audit accounts and provides all authentic and
            legitimate information about the financial record of a company and
            tracking the shuns and mishaps in the records. It is a remarkable
            course which implies skilful and technical mind-set to deal with
            huge numbers in a facile way. The salary packages are tremendously
            juicy and have made a heavy reputation in the industry with CA being
            a preferred course.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whereas CS refers to Company secretary also a professional certified
            course governed by the ICSI Institute of company secretaries of
            India. CS is a title for the managerial position in an organisation
            and not the administrative position as it refers to secretary.
            Instead CS are attorneys who have MBA's and main intentions lie in
            backing a managerial position to deal with the scope, responsibility
            that the company and all the co-workers along with the directors
            operate within the law and have smooth functioning in an
            organisation. Every organisation would definitely have a CS and CA.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both the courses time duration vary from country to country. CA
            takes more time to complete than CS. as CA takes about 5 years to
            finish to complete the three level exams and to complete the work
            requirement according to the experience. Whereas CS takes only about
            2-3 years to complete the course and to write the 3 level exams.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both the courses have their own importance and if any student wants
            to pursue either of this certification can take up the course
            depending upon their requirements as both have good career

            Construction and infrastructure are two variants of the same genre.
            But both have different names, different style of work, different
            syllabus and a great level of progress if properly achieved.
            Construction and Infrastructure are both most important elements of
            a humanâ€™s life as we all need a shelter to live in and all that we
            see around us is Infrastructure which also is a cardinal segment in
            the world. B.Tech Construction Engineering is a very dynamically
            extending course as it deals with the construction and designing of
            an indubitable structure in an applicable place wherever necessary
            and required space. With the help of construction engineering you
            can practically draft a plan of anything you wish to build for your
            own self or for the public. As advancements in technology are
            modifying, construction engineering is also picking pace and has
            great demands for engineers. And the best part is that, they can
            travel basically any part of the world as the job requires on site
            presence to check the smooth working of the construction. After
            completion one can go for tertiary level of education that means
            post-graduation which has been gaining imperishable opportunities
            for young aspirants as the job prospects are plenty. Whereas B. Tech
            Infrastructure Engineering is a 4 year undergraduate course which
            also deals in construction and is an important core competency of
            construction engineering. Infrastructure engineering deals with
            construction of the different methodologies in infrastructure of
            roads, tunnels, bridges, dams, towers, canals etc. The
            infrastructure engineering is a domain consisting of construction of
            an individual structure as a whole or the construction of an entire
            public community as whole. We do need infrastructure for our basic
            necessities to get fulfilled it could be a school, a building , an
            apartment, a bridge or even an underground tunnel on highways for
            people to cross roads and prevent accidents.
          </p>

          <p>
            In case of both the courses students have to go through entrance
            exam and have to score a minimum of 55% in PCB as their mandatory
            subjects. The scope for construction and infrastructure engineering
            is quite high both in India and abroad from personal living spaces
            to office arenas both the courses have fled an exceptional progress
            in engineering. Both the types of engineering promote a sustainable
            lifestyle and promote economic development.

            In today's world BSMS and BUMS are practically evolving as students
            are more relevant in coming up with new technologies to gratify the
            use of the ancient practices with new technologies. Both siddha and
            Unani are alternative to allopathic medicine. Where siddha medicine
            is a 4 and a half year course Unani is a 5.5 year course with a 1

            In order to get admission in Siddha one can get seat if they qualify
            the eligibility criteria and make way by writing NEET or BVP CET.
            whereas for Unani students have to write NEET and qualify the exam
            for a government seat. A BUM is governed by CCIM Central council of
            Indian Medicine. A BUM itself is a specialized programme and thus
            has no specializations involved. After the completion of their under
            graduate degrees students who have successfully completed siddha can
            work as pathologist, physiologist, dermatologist and much more. And
            for those who have completed their Unani medicine can work in
            enormous fields such as scientist, therapist, pharmacist, Hakeem and
            drug inspector. Both the courses are having enormous scope depending
            upon the interests and skills of students.
