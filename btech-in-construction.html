            B.Tech Construction Engineering is an integrated engineering discipline which formally operates and involves aspects of civil engineering as 
            well as construction management. Construction Engineering mainly lays more focus on designing, managing and overseeing the projects in the 
            construction industry. Construction engineering mainly manages and regulates construction projects and lays more emphasis on design of the 
            structure to be built in accordance with all safety security measures and specifications. Construction engineering can be a major specialization 
            in civil engineering. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
          The most chosen courses in the engineering spectrum, construction engineering is a 4 year under graduate degree in the engineering discipline which 
          studies the design area and the development of a structure also involving principal essence of civil engineering. A construction engineer is mainly 
          responsible to design, manage, oversee and build projects in a required industry. The projects might vary as they involve even the smallest of elements. 
          The type of projects that they take up are drainage and sewage system, designing the water supply, developing roads, railways, highways or even constructing a 
          building or a community. Construction engineering involves the engineers to take up various kinds of projects such as commercial building or civil building, 
          electrical and sewage system, plumbing and heating system, ventilation in the building etc. They are also into major construction and development of governmental 
          projects too. With a strong will power and determination altogether they put in the qualities will eventually lead them to a successful finishing of a project.

               Admissions for B.Tech Construction Engineering happens through entrance exams. Students can attend entrance exams 
               Which are conducted on state level, national level and university level. Students need to be more precise on what 
               level are they going to write and apply for the institution in prior. If they want to take up state wise entrance 
               exams, they can go ahead with that. Students need to have all updates of entrance dates, registration and admit card 
               issue. After the exam is being conducted and the shortlisted students will have to attend counselling round and 
               personal interview round and are given admissions. Some institutions also provide management seats under the management 
               quota. But the fees would be clearly very high. However, if the student is clear onto the institution and course can 
               apply directly on the institutions portal and wait for document verification and clear the fee before the due date.
