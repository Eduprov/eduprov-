            B.Tech Biomedical Engineering is an important course in the
            engineering domain which deals with the study, principles and
            application of medicine and biology in daily life. The very same
            Biomedical engineering studies the various principles, methodology,
            concepts and formulas that will be used in the medical and
            biological arena. Bio-medical engineering combines medicine and
            biology with engineering principles and practices to combine and
            design the technological biological science in improvising health
            care sector and to come up with new therapies.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            B.Tech Biomedical Engineering is a 4 year under graduate course
            which is further divided into 8 semesters. In this, students are
            taught the advanced principles of medical science in order to
            streamline an effective process of healthcare sector in the country.
            Biomedical engineering studies a wide array of treatments and
            diagnostics with plenty of therapeutic applications. Biomedical
            engineers assist the doctors and surgeons alongside practitioners in
            their trainings. The health care sector has been discerning a hike
            in the treatments and have been spreading awareness due to many such
            activities that which hamper the environment in a country. Due to
            the spread of awareness, many people are now keen on seeking
            biomedical solutions who are expertise in modern healthcare
            technology. As this has increased, we can see a rise in the
            employment opportunities of biomedical engineers all over the world
            and hence this point proves that biomedical engineering is a
            constructive course for students aspiring to take up the
            multidisciplinary approach of medical and science with technology
            and innovation.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            In the 4-year biomedical engineering course various methodologies of
            diagnosis are taught such as molecular system in all 3 streams of
            physics, chemistry and biology alongside tissue engineering.
            Analytical mathematics for calculus and geometric skills while
            designing medical solutions. Bio-medical students need to have good
            technical skills to interpret and analyze the data and come up with
            solutions to problems. Students can team up along with other groups
            to come up with better solutions to the problems. Bio-medical
            engineering covers all the latest and advanced technological trends
            in the field of biomedical industry.

            <p class="card-text text-dark">
              The admission process for B. Tech in biomedical engineering is
              just as similar to any other admission process in the engineering
              spectrum. Admissions happen in this course either through entrance
              exam or through merit or direct admissions. As the course is
              falling under the B. Tech patronage the criteria wouldn’t be that
              complicated.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text text-dark">
              In many colleges while getting through the merit list students
              need to qualify a particular cut off and the cut off for every
              college differs. Or if not the merit list then students can write
              the entrance exam in order to get good colleges. The entrance exam
              scores will be calculated along with the 12th board results and
              students will be allotted colleges and seats on the basis of
              rankings that they have scored. Those candidates who are writing
              their final exams or waiting for the results to be declared are
              also eligible to apply for entrance exams.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text text-dark">
              Entrance exams are conducted on different levels such as state
              level, national level and university level. Some private colleges
              conduct their own entrance exams for students in which
              mathematics, science, aptitude, and logical reasoning are valued.
              The other method is going through management quota for students
              which is other alternative if students won’t be able to qualify
              the exam. The fee structure and capitation would be very high in
              management seats.

              The career and scope for biomedical engineers has been considerably booming and has offered multiple career opportunities for students after their graduation. Biomedical engineering is a progressing field for young mindsets trying to renovate the existing technology in medicine and innovate the technology for advancements in the field. When engineering is applied in medical field that’s when it gives rise to biomedical engineering. With the growing health concerns in India, biomedical engineering has gone to become one of the most illuminating and stipulated streams that many young candidates would want to choose. 
              </p>

              <p class="card-text text-dark mt-2">
            Biomedical engineers not just create equipment’s and assist doctors but also used computerised software’s in healthcare sector for diagnosis of diseases and its treatments. A few major skills which make a biomedical engineer are good observatory skills, careful and accurate measurements, attention to minute details, good communication and team working skills. 
              </p>

              <p class="card-text text-dark mt-2">
               With the help of biomedical engineering and its specializations, students can come up with innovative technology for treatments such as artificial heart valves, joint replacements, are one of the most important examples of biomedical products in hospitals. Orthopaedic bio-engineering is responsible in designing and developing products which are relevant to bones, joints, ligaments etc. Biomedical engineering is also into making prosthetics.
