             B.Tech in Textile Engineering is a very well-known popular discipline of the engineering fields. Textile engineering has 
             reached miles across the world, as the textile sector plays a very important role in the growth of Indian economy. Textile 
             sector has been a part of Indian tradition and these two types of textile sectors. One is handloom and other is mechanized 
             sector. Textile engineering is the study which deals with the engineering principles is making different kinds of fabrics 
             and textiles and all types of yarns. It also involves the scientific study of making the fabric, its process from raw materials 
             to finished products. It studies the analysis of polymers with fibers, cotton clothing products and others related to textile. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              Textile engineering is a 4-year undergraduate course involves the creation, design, development and control of apparels that 
              involves the usage in our daily life. India has been the top manufacturer in cotton and silk. And since it has been excelling 
              in producing the best fibers it has also raised the standards of employment opportunities in different states. Bhilwara also 
              known as the ‘Textile City of India’, which is an industrial town in Rajasthan and it has emerged as India`s largest manufacturer 
              of fabric. 

            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
             The 4-year course is divided into 8 semesters and the course curriculum helps the students to understand the base knowledge of
            textiles along with its different processes, technology, production and processes which are interlinked with the textile industry. 
            Students learn to design and develop unique products. The study helps students to understand the theoretical and practical concepts 
            throughout the completion of the course. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            B.Tech Textile Engineering is apt for those who actually want to pursue a career in textile industry. This course provides 
            multidisciplinary study on world class education for textile technology. The students are taught polymer science, fiber
             manufacturing process, making yarns from raw materials to finished products. Textile engineering also studies an amount of 
             applied mechanics and mathematics. The different kinds of manufacturing processes and its plants for different industries and 
             factories are also taught. 
            </p>


             <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            There are almost 3400 textile mills which have the world`s most textile mills exceedingly more than 50 million spindles. 
            There are many states like Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh are well known for their 
            textile manufacturing. There are many textile industries in these states.

               The admission process for B. Tech Textile Engineering is generally through 3 processes. Either through entrance exams scores or through 
               12th board merits basis. There are many such colleges which admit students on the basis of their 10+2 scores. There is a set cut off 
               percentage in every college and it differs from one college to other. And if the student manages to score above the required cut off 
               then its easy to get admissions. Then the other alternative could be entrance exams. Entrance exams are conducted on state level, national
              level and university level. Some reputed colleges which are privatized, conduct their own entrance exam. The other option would be getting
              admissions through management quota. Management quota seats are less in number and are very expensive with capitation.
