              Because commerce is one such stream which gives the students a
              wide arena of career choices and options to pursue after 12th.
              students should have a certain aptitude to choose the field wisely
              is because they should have certain aptitude for commerce to be
              completely successful in it. If they have a hard liking towards
              science stream or humanities and want to pursue commerce for
              certain other reasons then they’ll find it hard to survive.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              Bachelor of Commerce or B.Com is the field of education that deals
              with the study of trade and trade activities such as exchange of
              goods and services from producers to final consumers. Overly it
              involves money and finance. Accountancy and business studies are
              two major constituents of commerce. Students who have an
              inclination towards numbers, money, finance who are fond about the
              economy and business can choose this field. The most common and
              important course after 12th covered under commerce is B Com.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              <b>B.Com</b> is an undergraduate degree in business and commerce for a
              duration of 3 years awarded to candidates once they complete this
              degree. The Bachelor of Commerce degree is designed in such a way
              that it gives students an insight into the major business world
              with different specifies and specializations, students are more
              exposed to <b>general business principles, taking professional
              courses in accounting , finance, economics, income tax, business
              management, human resources, banking and marketing.</b> So, depending
              upon the level of interest that a student is ready to pursue they
              can choose any specialization which will give them a grip into
              their career. Bachelor of commerce is divulged and gives students
              access to even distance education as this is a regular program.

                    There is no in general stream requirement as such we do in
