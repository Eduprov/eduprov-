              The admission process is very simple for B.Tech Fire and Safety Engineering. Students can attend entrance exams or get in direct admissions. Entrance exams are conducted state level, national level and there are also some private institutions which conduct their own entrance exams which are university level entrance exams. The student needs to firstly apply to whichever institute they want to get into which is offering the prescribed course. And then they can attend any entrance exam which will be listed below. Then after the results are out, candidates will be called for counseling sessions and personal interviews for those who were shortlisted with good ranking and seat allotment is done. 
              </p>
