            <b>B.Tech in Biochemical engineering</b> is majorly an interdisciplinary course combining biotechnology and chemical engineering to 
            make high end finished products. Biochemical engineering studies the concepts of biotechnology and chemicals to merge them in 
            order to convert the raw materials into finished products. It basically deals with the end to end products with the different 
            meticulous process to make an output. The B.Tech Biochemical engineering is a 4 year under graduate course in the engineering range. 
            The 4 years are further divided into 8 semesters having both practical and theoretical knowledge inducive classes which enhance the 
            student’s skills more while they put those skills into action. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
           <b>Biochemical engineering</b> is a multifaceted approach which is keener on teaching students the various concepts like process engineering, 
           material balance, thermodynamics, kinetics, reaction kinetics, bio-chemistry and more. As the name itself suggests Biochemical 
           engineering combines two applications of Biotechnology and chemical engineering along with biology that deals with design, study, 
           construction and invention of new process which involves the micro-organisms and molecular composition. 
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            Biochemical engineering is a much-known stream to many as it involves a lot in latest technology for various products such as 
            <b>cosmetics, vaccines, proteins, enzymes, pharmaceuticals, drugs, perfumes etc.</b> and then these raw materials are then being converted
             by very own biochemical engineering technical and scientific principles to achieve the finished product. 
          </p>

           <p class="text-justify text-dark">
         Biochemical engineering is mainly related to the scientific field and solve problems which are related to systems, materials and 
         processes that interact directly or indirectly with humans, plants, animals, microorganisms, biological interface. Most biochemical 
         engineers are used to working indoors such as laboratories, clinics, manufacturing plants, production plants, office building etc. 
         Biochemical engineering is a quiet stimulating course and involves a major amount of physics, chemistry and mathematics for which the 
         base should be sturdy.

          The <b>admission process for B.Tech biochemical engineering</b> is very simple and serene like the other engineering branches. 
          There are three ways in which a student can get admissions in B.Tech biochemical engineering. Either through merit basis and 
          entrance exam or direct admissions through management quota. The colleges will be having a set cut off percentage for merit 
          quota like 75% or 85%. And any student who attains marks in this margin or more then they can get in through it. And the student 
          needs to write an entrance exam and the board marks along with the entrance exam scores have been merged to give seats to students. 
          Entrance exams will be conducted on the national level or state level and private level. Then if not entrance exams students can get 
          admissions through the management quota with a management fee.
