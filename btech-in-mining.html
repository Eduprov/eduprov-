              B.Tech Mining Engineering is a most sought-after course in the engineering discipline. Mining engineering is considered as the study of mining which involves the engineering practical theories, science and technology from natural resources. 
We all know that there is a stringent need of minerals and few resources in our day to day life. And in order to extract those minerals there are standard rules, procedures, principles and techniques. This B. Tech in Mining Engineering is a discipline which deals with extraction of minerals and resources from the earth, utilizing the various methodologies to discover rare and new minerals through mining operations

            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            The course is highly industry driven and focuses on teaching new methodologies with industrial applications. It teaches students the thorough in-depth information of all kinds of minerals, mineral findings and their operations. It teaches students the niche of mining and to be more precise and more organized while mining. 

            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            Mining Engineering is a 4-year under graduate program that gives the students rigorous information on underground production and development, miners drill, blast operating, heavy mining, machineries, extracting coal, ores, underground mining etc. Mining engineering is a pre dominantly vast and diverse field in itself and the students shall be given all information about the various technicalities. There are two types of mining; one Is surface mining and the other one is underground mining. Both are quite distinctive in nature. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
            Mining Engineering is not only for the extraction of resources it involves all the phases of mining operations and is very well renowned course for locating natural resources such as coal, oil, petroleum, ores, etc. After all this it is also essential to restore and rehabilitate the land from where the extraction had taken place.

              <p class="text-justify text-dark">
               The admission process for B. Tech Mining Engineering happens either through direct admission or entrance exams/ merit basis. The admission policies differ from college to college. College will release a merit list and after the name of the student appears verification of documents will be done and the rest of the process continues. This is admissions based on merit basis. 


              </p>

              <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              For admissions based on entrance exams the registration will be done on the official website. Entrance exams are conducted state level, national level and university level. There is a list of entrance exams that students can get. The admit card and the examination date will be released by the concerned exam conducting body. 
              </p>

                <p class="text-justify text-dark">
                  The other method of getting admissions done is through management quota or direct admission. In every college there are a few seats reserved for the management quota. Any student who weren’t able to fulfil the eligibility criteria can get into management seats. Management seats are with capitation and require a good sum of money for admissions. Many students either write entrance exams and get admissions according to the seat allotment while many get into merit basis.

           B.Tech Mining engineering graduates, can either work or continue their higher education such as post- graduation in M. Tech. Mining engineering is that field of engineering that involves the scientific and technological aspects thus employing candidates who can put their skills into action for the extraction of minerals and other resources from underground. Aside from minerals, there are other varieties of natural resources which are deep under the earth`s surface. The main responsibility of mining engineers is to explore, survey, research, identify, extract and process those natural resources. Their job responsibilities also include environmental protection, waste management and project issues and submissions.

                  Mining engineers are usually recruited by mining companies which are into exploration, research, discovery of such natural resources. The scope for mining engineers is high not just in India but also in abroad which are dealers in various minerals and are into export and import. There are job opportunities for mining engineers in private sectors, public and government sectors. And many of these sectors are dependent on these engineers for their work to be done.
