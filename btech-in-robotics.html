              B.Tech Robotics engineering is one of the most prominent and
              emerging field in the engineering structure. Robotics Engineering
              is a very interesting and inventive field which involves multiple
              options to create a desired output. B.Tech Robotics Engineering is
              a 4 year under graduate course which studies the different
              mechanisms such as computer engineering, mechanical engineering
              and electrical engineering to design and develop an automated
              system.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              B.Tech Robotic engineering deals with studying the basic concepts
              of computer and technology with mechanical principles and
              electrical knowledge which utilizes to develop embedded automation
              systems. The technological era of development has led to increase
              and rise in the usage of different applied sciences in our day to
              day life. Artificial intelligence (AI) based applications is one
              of such application used in creating an embedded networking
              system.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              The robotics engineering teaches students to create a better
              version of robotic designing not just in the robotic industry but
              also the technology will be used in various other fields and in
              the entire manufacturing sector. B. Tech Robotic engineers are
              more prone to create robots for usage in human life in actuality.
              B. Tech Robotic engineering is an interdisciplinary program which
              deals with the designing and development of robots to be utilized
              in various sectors such as manufacturing sector, military, marine,
              defence, medical and army sectors.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify text-dark">
              B.Tech Robotic engineering is best suited for those students who
              desire to pursue a career in robotics and have a fervent towards
              robots and artificial technology for real human life. After
              finishing their Robotics in engineering students can join for
              their further education such as M. Tech in Robotic engineering
              which is for a tenure of 2 years in automation and system. For
              those who want to do more research and gain knowledge on Robotics
              and its system can join the PhD program in Robotics.
